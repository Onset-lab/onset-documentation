# Tractoflow

Tractoflow is an automated pipeline designed for the processing of diffusion MRI data, with a strong focus on reproducibility and robustness. It streamlines the entire workflow required for brain tractography, including image preprocessing, diffusion modeling, and the generation of tractograms. Tractoflow leverages modern workflow management tools to ensure that each processing step is executed efficiently and consistently, making it suitable for both small-scale studies and large neuroimaging projects.

For detailed instructions on installation, configuration, and running Tractoflow, please refer to the official documentation: [ðŸ“– Tractoflow Documentation](https://tractoflow-documentation.readthedocs.io/)
