# Surface Enhanced Tractography

Surface Enhanced Tractography (SET) is an advanced method for improving the accuracy of tractography in diffusion MRI by incorporating surface information. This technique enhances the reconstruction of white matter pathways, leading to more reliable and anatomically plausible results.
